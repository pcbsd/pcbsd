General roadmap for the Lumina Project to reach version 1.0
----------------------------------------

TO-DO
---------
Lumina-desktop
 - Create a few desktop plugins 
   -- Plugins: directory viewer, image viewer, note taker
   -- Default Plugins: 1 directory viewer (home dir)
 - Create a couple more panel plugins
   -- Clean up clock plugin (add calender widget to a menu, and ability to customize time display)
 - Add ability for customized user icon for the user button (~/.lumina/user.png?)
 - Finish up the system tray
   -- Retroactive app detection/embedding

Lumina-config
 - Check/clean up the key press detector (particularly special keys)
 
Lumina-fm (Insight?)
 - Network protocol support (samba, ftp, others?)
   -- This is optional usage (only shown as available if the utilities are installed)

Lumina-open
 - Still not happy with the available apps widget. Perhaps go to something that can be scrolled?

Write a screenshot-taking program to tie into the "print-screen" button
 - lumina-screenshot?
 - Uses pre-set QPixmap options for capturing an X11 window (quite simple)
 - Save the image as either a *.png or *.jpg
 - Add this utility to the "core" Lumina desktop (since it is tiny and does not require more dependencies)
 
Write a quicklaunch application (Fluxbox Alt-F2 replacement)
 - lumina-quicklaunch?
 - allows the user to either run a specific command or start an application
 
Write a filesystem search application
 - lumina-search, or combine with lumina-quicklaunch?
 - Simple utility to search the home directory for particular files or find an application
 
-----------------------
ROADMAP to 1.0
-----------------------
0.7 - Create lumina-screenshot and lumina-search and integrate with keyboard shortcuts (printscreen/ALT-F2)
0.8 - Create new desktop plugins / other


------------------------------------------
Optional Extensions after 1.0-RELEASE
------------------------------------------
Write a screen-locking system (needs PAM/security class)
  - Don't actually lock/open the PAM session (that could break the login session)
  - Just for verification of credentials for the desired user (current or admin)
  
Parental Control System (needs screen locker, OS-specific network protocols)
  - Daily Time Limits (simple to do)
  - Network Accessibility Whitelist (using capsicum?)

Replace xscreensaver with a custom-written screensaver framework in Qt (needs screen locker)
  - xscreensaver has some (possibe) security concerns due to 
     network-accessable perl modules that are required
  - Since the Lumina session already has to keep an eye on system events,
     if it probably better just to maintainer our own internal timer systems instead
     of running an additional background daemon (also reduces dependencies).

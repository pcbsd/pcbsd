This directory contains scripts for any selected driver in the Xorg-gui which
may need a special setup after the xorg.conf is generated. 

This may include loading drivers, tweaking configs, etc. 

The script name should match the corresponding entery in the drivers.txt and
alias.txt files in /usr/PCBSD/xorg-gui/settings/ directory.
